## Questions for Analysis:

* Do movies with high popularity achieve high revenue?
* What are the most filmed genres in this whole dataset?
* Is there a correlation between a movie budget and its revenue?

## Data Cleaning:

Main Observations:

1. Our dataset consisted of a total of 10866 rows and 21 columns.
2. We had only 1 duplicated row which had been dropped.
3. Some columns won't be useful in answering our questions so they were dropped.
4. A few columns had many missing values that needed to be handled.
5. Columns cast director genre had values separated with a '|'.
6. release_date's data type needed to be cast.
7. We could append a column for the movie profit using the formula: profit=revenueâˆ’budget.
8. vote_average better be presented as a categorical variable that groups multiple rating values.
9. We might also categorize the profit column for better EDA

## Exploratory Data Analysis: 

After finishing our dataset cleaning, we ended up with a total of 10840 records and 10 columns. The dataset now has no duplicates nor null values, and the data types are consistent with suitable categorical variables to address our questions. We then performed some analytics and created some visualizations to answer our targeted questions.


**Q1: Do movies with high popularity achieve high revenue?**
> More popular movies receive way more revenue than less popular movies.

**Q2: What are the most filmed genres in this whole dataset?**
> Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most three filmed genres in a total of 10839 movies in our dataset.
The drama genre alone is filmed 22.6% of the time on our dataset.


**Q3: Is there a correlation between a movie budget and its revenue?**
>There is a positive correlation between budget and revenue, indicating a relation between them with little outliers found.
